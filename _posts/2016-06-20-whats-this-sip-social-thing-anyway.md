  The Sip Social is a growing group of fun loving and socially sophisticated
  sippers with a genuine interest in their communityâ€™s social wellbeing. We love
  meeting new people, pushing ourselves out of our comfort zone to make
  connections, and helping others to do the same. We believe that a rich and
  dynamic social life is very important to our overall happiness. At Sip Social
  gatherings members can enjoy a beverage while sharing stories, laughs,
  networking, and actively engaging each other in conversation about life and
  whatever catches our fancy. They can take place at restaurants, pubs, coffee
  shops, or even juice bars. We believe that good people surround themselves
  with other good people and that is why we grow by invite only. Members are
  encouraged to invite friends & colleagues to foster interesting conversation
  and synergy.

The Sip Social is a growing group of fun loving and socially sophisticated sippers with a genuine interest in their community's social wellbeing. We love meeting new people, pushing ourselves out of our comfort zone to make connections, and helping others to do the same. We believe that a rich and dynamic social life is very important to our overall happiness. At Sip Social gatherings members can enjoy a beverage while sharing stories, laughs, networking, and actively engaging each other in conversation about life and whatever catches our fancy. They can take place at restaurants, pubs, coffee shops, or even juice bars. We believe that good people surround themselves with other good people and that is why we grow by invite only. Members are encouraged to invite friends & colleagues to foster interesting conversation and synergy. 

Follow our page for details about upcoming events in your area. We aim to break down the barriers to interpersonal connection in a warm atmosphere with a spirit of adventure and curiosity, one sip at a time. In pursuit of our light-hearted mission, we aim to swarm a venue in community rather than spread out across the city as lone social pioneers (although we encourage each other to do both). And what better way for a bunch of socially confident, beverage-loving folks to draw attention to a cause? Cheers to making our neighbourhoods friendlier places to live!
