            <title><![CDATA[What's this Sip Social thing, anyway?]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The Sip Social is a growing group of fun loving and socially sophisticated sippers with a genuine interest in their communityâ€™s social wellbeing. We love meeting new people, pushing ourselves out of our comfort zone to make connections, and helping others to do the same. We believe that a rich and dynamic social life is very important to our overall happiness. At Sip Social gatherings members can enjoy a beverage while sharing stories, laughs, networking, and actively engaging each other in conversation about life and whatever catches our fancy. They can take place at restaurants, pubs, coffee shops, or even juice bars. We believe that good people surround themselves with other good people and that is why we grow by invite only. Members are encouraged to invite friends & colleagues to foster interesting conversation and synergy. </p>]]></description>
